## It's like having your own emissary
Emissary is a highly customizable reputation tracker for your FoundryVTT games. The goal is to not support a single system, but to allow for any system or game (whether they have a published reputation system or not) to track the sociopolitical and personal progress of a group and its individual members. Tailor your reputation to your party's taste!

## Extreme customization
Customize everything from the "ranks" of reputation to the number of "reputation points" each button click provides. Add and remove factions, cities, and characters from the reputation tracker quickly and easily. Decide how much or how little players in the game are able to see - even hiding some of the factions that are working behind the scenes!

## Add context and information to entities
Link journal entries to your entities so that you can view quick information about them!

Use Emissary in the best way that works for you!
